### README: Server-Side API for Google Books Integration

---

#### **Overview**

This project provides a server-side API built with Express.js that interacts with the Google Books API. It acts as a middleware between the frontend application and the Google Books API, allowing users to search, fetch, and interact with book data.

---

### **Features**

1. **Search for Books**

   - Endpoint: `/api/books`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Description: Fetches a list of books based on a search query. If no query is provided, it returns the top 20 books in the "fiction" category.
   - Query Parameters:
     - `q` (optional): The search term (e.g., "fiction", "Harry Potter").
   - Response: A JSON object containing book details, including title, authors, and descriptions.

   Example Request:

   ```bash
   GET /api/books?q=harry+potter&max=20
   ```

   Example Response:

   ```json
   {
     "kind": "books#volumes",
     "items": [
       {
         "id": "123abc",
         "volumeInfo": {
           "title": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
           "authors": ["J.K. Rowling"],
           "description": "A young wizard's journey...",
           "publisher": "Bloomsbury"
         }
       },
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Fetch Top Books**

   - If no query (`q`), or max-length (`max`) is passed, the API defaults to returning the top 20 books in the "fiction" category.

3. **Error Handling**

   - Handles errors gracefully, including cases where the Google Books API rejects the request or the API key is invalid.

   Example Error Response:

   ```json
   {
     "error": "Failed to fetch books. Please try again later.",
     "detail": `${e.stack}`,
     "msg": `${e.message}`
   }
   ```

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API key:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the API**
   By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3500`. Use tools like Postman or a browser to test endpoints.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **Express.js**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Google Books API**: Provides book data for queries.

---

### **Future Improvements**

- Add user authentication for personalized book collections.
- Implement caching to reduce API requests.
- Add endpoints for CRUD operations on a local database of books.
